# Fake News Detection With Sentiment Analysis

In this project, I analyze english articles with FastText and XGBoost.

The goal is to create a system, which will be able to classify a specific article as a fake news or a legitimite one.

## Motivation

Starting with my project Mej Prehled, I began to be concerned with distributing information and avoiding fake news. However, fake news detection is still almost impossible with todays technology. Therefore in this project, I would like to set up a benchmark, so when I am working on a future projects concerning this problem, I will have something to compare them to.

## Conclusion

I was able to create a model with about 98% accuracy. This percentage surpass my expectation. However, if we wanted to improve the model, I would suggest using some more modern models, for example BERT or ELECTRA.

## How To Reproduce

Download the Jupyter notebook and the FastText model from https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html. Then just ran the notebook and wait for the results.
